    <br> <h4>Hailey started working in childcare</h4>
        <p>
        She started by babysitting her cousins, brother and sister,
         and neighborhood kids. Childcare and working with children was all that she knew up until her mid 20’s. She was going 
         to school for Early Childhood Education.
        </p>
        <br><p>After her second year as a prekindergarten assistant teacher, she found herself stuck and taken
             advantage of by her employer. After much consideration, stress, crying and soul searching she decided 
             to leave the world of childcare and education.
             <br></p>
             <p>
            She applied at one place, an insurance company and the rest is history. She currently works for a major health insurance company and loves what she does. She has found a company and a 
            job that makes her excited to show up every day and learn and help people. The most challenging part of her job is
             fighting the “Imposter syndrome”. Since starting her job 1 year ago Hailey has gotten 2 raises with the 2 promotions.
              She now trains newcomers to the company and can say how the training is done.
