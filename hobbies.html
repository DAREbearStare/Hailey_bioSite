    <p>Hailey DeLira states that she is most thankful for the hard times and struggles she had in her life. She is thankful for them because they have pushed her to be a better, tougher version of herself and helped her enjoy what she has now. It has helped her appreciate her life today because she has worked so hard to achieve them.
        She is married with 2 dogs and is working a job that she enjoys with a company she never saw herself working at. She likes to read, do puzzles, color adult coloring books and train her dog, Tilly. Her favorite animal is also her spirit animal, Sloths. “They are so cute! And sometimes I think about how I wish I would slow down and live at a sloth’s pace”. She loves anything Harry Potter and Legos.
        She currently works for a major health insurance company and loves what she does. She has found a company and a job that makes her excited to show up every day and learn and help people. The most challenging part of her job is fighting the “Imposter syndrome”. Since starting her job 1 year ago Hailey has gotten 2 raises with the 2 promotions. She now trains newcomers to the company and can say how the training is done.
        This was not always the case though.
        Starting in her teens Hailey because working in childcare. She started by babysitting her cousins, brother and sister, and neighborhood kids. Childcare and working with children was all that she knew up until her mid 20’s. She was going to school for Early Childhood Education.
        After her second year as a prekindergarten assistant teacher, she found herself stuck and taken advantage of by her employer. After much consideration, stress, crying and soul searching she decided to leave the world of childcare and education.
        She applied at one place, an insurance company and the rest is history.
